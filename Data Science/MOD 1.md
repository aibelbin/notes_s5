Data is collection of raw facts, figures, and symbols that can be processed and analyzed to provide meaningful information and insights


## Types of data 

	`talk about rows and coloums and also about the data model`
### Structured 


Structured data is the data which conforms to a
**data model**, has a well define structure, follows a
consistent order and can be easily accessed and
used by a person or a computer program.

 Structured data is usually stored in well-defined
schemas such as Databases. It is generally tabular
with column and rows that clearly define its
attributes.

### Unstructured 

Unstructured data is the data which does not
conforms to a data model and has no easily
identifiable structure such that it can not be
used by a computer program easily.

 
Unstructured data is not organised in a pre-
defined manner or does not have a pre-defined
data model, thus it is not a good fit for a
mainstream relational database.


### Semi Structured 

Semi-structured data is data that does not
conform to a data model but has some
structure.

It lacks a fixed or rigid schema, has metadata

It is the data that does not reside ina
rational database but that have some
organizational properties that make it easier
to analyze.


## Dataset 

it is an organised collection of data normally presented in a tabular format, every value in a dataset is known as a **datum** 

**Pattern** is the recurring trends or structures present in the dataset, understanding this is a crucial part of data analysis to understand more about the dataset 


## What is data science? 

 Data Science is about data gathering, analysis and decision-
making.

Data Science is about finding patterns in data through
analysis and making future predictions.

## Ethical and Privacy Implication of Data science 

1. Empathy
2. Data Control 
3. Transperancy 
4. Equlaity 
5. Accountability 


## Data science vs Data Analytics 

### Data Science 

Data Science is a field that deals with
extracting meaningful information and insights by
applying various algorithms, processes, scientific methods
from structured and unstructured data. This field is
related to big data and one of the most demanded skills
currently.

### Data Analytics 

Data Analytics is used to get conclusions
by processing the raw data. It is helpful in various
businesses as it helps the company to make decisions
based upon the conclusions from the data. Basically, data
analytics helps to convert a Large number of figures in the
form of data into Plain English i.e., conclusions which are
further helpful in making the decisions

## Difference

## Data science process 

(1) understanding the problem
(2) preparing the data samples
(3) developing the model
(4) applying the model on a dataset to see how the model may work in the real
world,
(5) deploying and maintaining the models




**outliers** are anomalies in the given dataset 

reducing the number of attributes without significant loss in the perfomance of the model is known as **feature selection**

**Sampling** is a process of selecting a subset of records as a representation of original dataset used for modelling


## Modelling 

the data is split to training and test data 

A model should not memorize and output the same values that are in the training
records. **overfitting**
An over fitted model will underperform on real unlabelled new data.

Prediction error is calculated by cross checking the predicted values with the actual values
