## Data Mining 

Data mining is discovering or mining knowledge from large set of data 

The data sources can include databases, data warehouses, the Web, and other
information repositories

Data mining turns  large collection of data into knowledge 


## Steps involved in knowledge discovery 

1. Data cleaning 
2. Data integration 
3. Data selection 
4. Data Transformation
5. Data Mining
6. Pattern Evaluation 
7. Knowledge presentation 


### Predictive models 

These models make predictions based on datasets it was trained on 

### Descriptive models 

These models learn the properties and hidden trends in the dataset 


### Classification 

Classification maps data  into predefined groups or classes 

### Regression 

Regression is used to map a data item to a
real valued prediction. Regression assumes that the
target data fit into some known type of function



## Clustering 

Clustering is grouping together similar data of the dataset but it is different from classification as clustering does not have any predefined classes meanwhile classification does  

### Sequence Discovery 

Sequential analysis or sequence discovery is used to
determine sequential patterns in data.


## Knowledge Discovery and Data mining 

Knowledge discovery in
databases (KDD) is the process of finding useful
information and patterns in data

Data mining is the use of
algorithms to extract the information and
patterns derived by the KDD process.


## Data Processing 

Data preprocessing is the process of transforming data into an more understandable format 


## Major tasks in Data Preprocessing 

1. Data cleaning 
2. Data Integration
3. Data reduction 
4. Data Transformation 
5. Data Discretization 


**Data cleaning**  is the process of removng incorrect data and inaccurate data  from the dataset 
**Noisy Data** is the data with large amount of useless information in them 



### Ways to tackle Noisy data 

1. Binning 
2. Regression 
3. Outlier analysis
